A C++ Concepts Primer
=====================

by **Erik Sven Vasconcelos Jansson** in mid-2018.

Abstract

Documents

* **[Primer (pdf)](primer/primer.pdf):** the primer itself, which consists of a short overview of *generic programming* in a  pre-concepts world, the problems with *unconstrained template parameters*, what methods we already have (e.g. *type traits and SFINAE*) when solving these problems, and why they are *insufficient*. Then, present *concepts*, a way to *constrain template parameters* by using the `requires` *clause*, and the *requires expression*, a way to specify *requirements* needed upon *instantiation*. The primer also covers *standard library concepts*, and the different *terse syntaxes* proposed for C++20, and the *status*.
* **[Slides (pdf)](slides/slides.pdf):** essentially the same information as the above, but condensed, and not as good. Only for an introduction.
