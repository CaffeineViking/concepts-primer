\subsection*{Building Examples}

Alongside this document you'll find plenty of examples on how to use concepts, and you'll be happy to know \emph{almost} all of them compile out-of-the-box when using GCC with the \texttt{-fconcepts} flag. If you are a boring person, you can clone the \href{https://github.com/CaffeineViking/concepts-primer}{\texttt{repository}}, or, if you're feeling adventurous, \underline{\emph{unzip}} this PDF by:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, morekeywords={unzip, make},
                                  deletekeywords={test}]
unzip concepts-primer.pdf
cd examples
make gcc-test && make -j8
\end{lstlisting}
