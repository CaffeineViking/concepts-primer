\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Right now \Cpp\ is experiencing a \emph{renaissance}, fueled by new language features and an extended standard library introduced with \Cpp11, \Cpp14, and \Cpp17. It's a different beast than \Cpp98 (want to feel old?: that's two decades ago), while still keeping to its core philosophies: the \emph{zero-overhead principle}, having a \emph{simple \& direct mapping to hardware}, and to be completely \emph{multi-paradigm}. The language has become more powerful, but also simpler, since a lot of the rough edges in \Cpp98 have been removed, or replaced, with modern variants. Interest in \Cpp\ has surged again, and with \Cpp20 coming soon\texttrademark, doubly so.

\subsection*{Building Examples}

Alongside this document you'll find plenty of examples on how to use concepts, and you'll be happy to know \emph{almost} all of them compile out-of-the-box when using GCC with the \texttt{-fconcepts} flag! If you are a boring person, you can clone the \href{https://github.com/CaffeineViking/concepts-primer}{repository}, or, if you're feeling adventurous, \underline{\emph{unzip}} this PDF with:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash, morekeywords={unzip, make},
                                  deletekeywords={test}]
unzip concepts-primer.pdf
cd examples
make gcc-test && make -j8
\end{lstlisting}
