\begin{itemize}
    \item{\textbf{Roger Orr:} for his awesome ``\emph{Concepts Lite in Practice}'' \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Z-RbygAlw}{talk} and for the \href{https://accu.org/index.php/journals/2246}{article} from ACCU 2016. Some motivating examples (e.g bad errors, and type traits) in this primer are borrowed (with consent) from there.}
    \item{\textbf{Andrew Sutton:} for another great \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rBhX-FJCdg}{talk}: ``\emph{Generic Programming with Concepts}'' at \Cpp Now 2015. Many of the early examples in this primer are based from that talk (with some modifications); consent acquired.}
    \item{\textbf{Peter Sommerlad:} and the rest of the committee, for allowing me to participate in the discussion on Concepts, Modules and Contracts in the \emph{Rapperswil} 2018 EWG meeting. It was great fun, and it was very interesting to get a perspective on how the commitee operates; while the work was tiring (reading so many papers...), it was very rewarding!}
    \item{\textbf{Tobias Lasser:} and the rest of the teachers/participants in the course seminar ``\emph{Discovering and Teaching Modern \Cpp}'', for very interesting talks and for providing a platform where like-minded people can discuss and teach modern \Cpp\ to each other. It forced me (being really lazy), to write something that might (?) be useful (I hope?) to others as well.}
