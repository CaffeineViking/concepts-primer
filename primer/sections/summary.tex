\subsection*{Current Status}

    Below follows the current status and release forecast for the features touched upon in this primer. Most are derived in \emph{Herb Sutter's} excellent \href{https://herbsutter.com/2018/07/02/trip-report-summer-iso-c-standards-meeting-rapperswil/}{Trip Report}, but I've also taken into account various other sources, along with my biased predictions based on the experiences from the Rapperswil 2018 \Cpp\ meeting.
